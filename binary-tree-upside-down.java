/*
Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5

Output: return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1]

   4
  / \
 5   2
    / \
   3   1
